Note that "Episode_cloud_modified.svg" and "Episode_cloud_modified.png" was produced by modifying "episode_cloud_original.png" using Adobe Illustrator (Tryout, ver 28.0) (64-bit). <br>
1. Using (Window > Image Trace > Preset = High Fidelity Photo), the cloud image was visually refined. <br>
2. The cloud was overlapped with the real TARDIS image of transparency = 6%. <br>
(Real TARDIS image acquired from ["https://www.pinterest.ch/pin/217439488237426204](https://www.pinterest.ch/pin/217439488237426204/) (accessed in 2023-11-29) )
3. The title, subtitle, and caption text were added with the same setting as those in "dr_who(2023-11-27).R".
4. The image was exported to a ".png" file with resolution = "High (300ppi)", and a ".svg" file with the default setting.
