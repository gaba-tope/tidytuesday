Note that "Episode_cloud_modified.svg" and "Episode_cloud_modified.png" was produced from the following steps: <br>
The original image was modified using Adobe Illustrator (Tryout, ver 28.0) (64-bit) <br>
1. Using (Window > Image Trace > Preset = High Fidelity Photo), the cloud image was visually refined. <br>
2. The cloud was overlapped with the real TARDIS image of transparency = 6%. <br>
(Real TARDIS image acquired from ["https://www.pinterest.ch/pin/217439488237426204/"]("https://www.pinterest.ch/pin/217439488237426204/") (accessed in 2023-11-29) )
3. The caption text was added with the same setting as the caption text in "dr_who(2023-11-27).R".
